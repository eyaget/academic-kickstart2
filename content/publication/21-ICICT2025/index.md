abstract: "In recent years, the integration of deep learning techniques, particularly computer vision, into smart agriculture has emerged as a powerful tool to revolutionize traditional farming practices. As global demand for food production continues to rise, coupled with the increasing need for resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural systems, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) has become crucial. Deep learning techniques enable models to analyze vast amounts of agricultural data, such as field images, sensor readings, and environmental conditions, to provide real-time and data-driven insights. These insights allow for more precise and informed decision-making across various farming operations, including crop health monitoring, disease detection, weed management, and yield prediction. In addition to reviewing the current state-of-the-art technologies, this paper discusses the challenges that limit the widespread adoption of AI in agriculture. These challenges include the scarcity of labeled and high-quality datasets, difficulties in generalizing AI models to diverse environmental conditions, and computational limitations in deploying AI-powered systems in low-resource settings. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to these issues, including data augmentation, domain adaptation, and model compression techniques, which aim to make deep learning models more accessible and scalable in real-world agricultural environments."
