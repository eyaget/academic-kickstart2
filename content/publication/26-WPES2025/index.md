abstract: It is with great pleasure that I reflect on my role as Program Committee Chair for WPES 2025. The success of this conference is a testament to the collective dedication and tireless efforts of many individuals. First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the authors whose innovative research and contributions form the foundation of this year's program. I am equally indebted to the Program Committee members and reviewers, whose expertise, rigor, and commitment ensured the high quality of the accepted submissions. Your thoughtful evaluations and constructive feedback have been invaluable. I would like to particularly thank the Publication Chair, Daniel Reijsbergen, for taking care of the proceedings, and the Web Chair, Eyasu Getahun Chekole, for creating and maintaining the conference website. Finally, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the steering committee for their guidance and support throughout this journey. Their leadership has been crucial in navigating challenges and realizing our goals. It is with great excitement that we see such a large number of high-quality submissions from all over the world. Many submissions present novel contributions related to real-world aspects of digital privacy, demonstrating accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. A total of 37 submissions were received, of which 31 were full papers and 6 were short papers. Their leadership has been crucial in navigating challenges and realizing our goals.
