I earned my PhD in *Cybersecurity (Computer Science)* from [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) in 2019 (supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Sudipta Chattopadhyay](https://asset-group.github.io/), [Dr. Martin Ochoa](https://martin-ochoa.github.io/) and [Assoc. Prof. Huaqun Guo](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/huaqun-guo)), my MSc in *Computer Science* from [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) in 2012 (supervised by [Prof. Bruno Crispo](http://disi.unitn.it/~crispo/)), and my BSc in *Computer Science & IT* from [Arba Minch University](https://www.amu.edu.et/) in 2008. 

Currently, I am a Research Fellow in Cybersecurity with [Prof. Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/) at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) (in Singapore). Previously, I was a *Research Scientist* in Cybersecurity at the [Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) (in Singapore), a *Software Engineer* at [Femar Consulting s.r.l](https://www.femarconsulting.com/) (in Italy), a *Research Collaborator* in Cybersecurity at the [Security \& Trust (ST)](https://st.fbk.eu/) unit of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/) (in Italy), a Research Intern at [Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC)](http://adsc.illinois.edu/) (in Singapore), and a *Software Engineer* in Cybersecurity at [Information Network Security Administration (INSA)](https://www.insa.gov.et/) (in Ethiopia).
